My name is Lukas (Strupf) and I'm from Germany.

I like tinkering with low level programming and gamedev since I took an IT course in high school. Other notable interests are do-it-yourself hifi, cooking and reading science fiction. I have a degree in mechanical engineering and am also working in that field.

This site is mostly an outlet for some more or less random thoughts and side projects of mine.
