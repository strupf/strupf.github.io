I am making a platformer for the Playdate. This page shall serve the index of the individual entries to come.

It'll be a slower paced adventure platformer. While I also like fast paced "mashing the dash button" games I want to explore more deliberate movement. I love Zelda: Wind Waker, Link's Awakening, A Hat In Time, Celeste, 2D Metroid, Axiom Verge, Valheim. Most of these games have a certain "good vibes" feel to them, and a big focus on exploration, adventure, growing.

They rely on the usage of different tools/items and a blend of different moods/themes: On the one hand, there are relaxing places like a sleepy village, your hideout and the peaceful nature. Places to calm down and where you like to spend time in. On the other hand there are grim dungeons and dangerous places, filled with all kinds of unknown stuff, creatures and mysteries. I really like that back and forth. In the end most of the game will be designed as I go and based on what I like while iterating - bottom-up.
