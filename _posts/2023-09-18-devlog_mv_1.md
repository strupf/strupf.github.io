First off, you can create games for the Playdate in either Lua or C. With some tinkering people also get the toolchain to compile C++ but it doesn't seem to be too stable. Because I'm familiar with programming C it'll be the language of choice. The improved performance compared to Lua is important, too. The CPU is a 168 MHz Cortex M7 (32-bit, single-threaded) without a dedicated graphics or audio chip so this little thing really has some work to do. Compare that to any modern 4000 MHz desktop CPU with multiple threads and SIMD capabilities and it's clear that there are some serious constraints on compute power.

I'm building my game engine for two backends which are wrapped behind a single API: One backend is built on top of the Playdate SDK for the actual hardware itself, the other backend uses [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) so the game can also be compiled and executed as a native Desktop or Web Assembly app. Beause of my love for low-level programming I reduce the use of the Playdate SDK to its absolutely barebones IO features and write all of the graphics and audio handling myself.

As of today I am mostly using these programs:
* Visual Studio (IDE)
* Aseprite (pixel art)
* Bfxr (sfx)
* Audacity (general audio)
* Tiled (map editor)
